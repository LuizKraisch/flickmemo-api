## Setup

Here's a guide to put Flickmemo's API to work:

1 - Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/LuizKraisch/flickmemo-api`

2 - Navigate to the project directory:

`cd flickmemo-api`

3 - Build the Docker image using `docker-compose` (you'll need to install it!):

`docker-compose build`

3 - Start the Docker containers:

`docker-compose up -d`

4 - Access the API by the URL: `http://localhost:3000` or use another port that you prefer (remember to configure on DockerFile).
