# Monitoring

For Flickmemo's events and bugs monitoring it's being used New Relic and Bugsnag.

### Busgnag

Bugsnag works fine with Ruby on Rails-based applications and also has some interesting features related to app performance.

### New Relic

New Relic is also used as an alternative for Bugsnag since the free tier available limits the issues filters by 7 days. New Relic has more
options for that and also offers more solutions for performance and logs.

It's also one of the best options available in the market.
