## About the App

Flickmemo is a mobile app that helps to organize the movies that you saw or want to see. It allows users to discover new movies based on their 
interests, review them or add them to their watchlist. All this is powered by The Movie Database [free API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).

Flickmemo provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface to provide the best experience. The motivation to build it is to have a simple
and a quick tool to add movies without having to create accounts in tons of places.
